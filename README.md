# shujav2 - exposing a fraudulent dev with the same platform he scammed on
source for shuja exposing video
watch the video for context - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsMfJwomTiw
here's the project files for the video.

certain unused files are included (besides those that had private info, im not trying to dox him, nor those associated with him.)
one file is too big to be included here, you'll have to download it yourself.

yes, im using github to host a video's project files. no proprietary here :trollface:

hardware/software used:
Dell Latitude E5570 (256G + 8G)
Intel Core i5 6200u
Intel HD 530
kdenlive 23.04.0
Mix of integrated display and ASUS 1080p VA display (horrible BFI)

(this is what happens when android dev makes a video)
