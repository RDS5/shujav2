00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Meet Syed Muhammad Shuja Haider

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:04,956
...Or as he goes by his other aliases:

3
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:08,957
YourHit, Shuja or Shuja-HaiderDEV.

4
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:14,286
He has a story of lies, unmet promises and vaporware

5
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:17,857
He started off like any software developer, projects here and there, nothing special.

6
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:21,229
In the month of October in 2022 Shuja would start a project

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,014
...that would aim to reshape modding of blackberry devices entirely. 

8
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,800
He would name this project HaxBerry.

9
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:31,700
HæxBerry was just like any other software project and quite quickly people caught wind of it

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:37,529
Around this time, people desperate for another way to hack their blackberries decided to help.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,571
...what they thought was a developer in need of more hardware, and so they sent devices after devices to him, expecting exploits back.

12
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:48,743
Trusting him was one of their biggest mistakes.

13
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,972
Shuja had already started making promises and at this point,

14
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:55,771
had broken every. single. one. of. them.

15
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,571
Eventually, the devices he had lied to obtain for free had arrived.

16
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:03,271
And a group of absolutely ripped open-source professionals decided to

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,271
...press on for details on the progress of his project.

18
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:10,857
This obviously made him quite uneasy, so he tried everything to distract them,

19
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:13,733
From personal attacks to other distraction techniques.

20
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:17,256
Obviously, they saw straight through his shit and he finally cracked,

21
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:22,950
giving us a date.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,910
That date is today, and theres still absolutely no source code or update on HæxBerry.

23
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:32,762
With no source or release or even S*uja, the community felt betrayed.

24
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:37,171
He delivered promises but never delivered a product, taking others devices with him as well.

25
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:38,064
Avoid S*uja.

26
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:42,768
He is not a person to be trusted.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,278

Happy Mother's day.

28
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,200
We <3 Alyssa!

29
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,241
* Some very nice words to Shuja. *
